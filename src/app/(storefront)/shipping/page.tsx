          <p>
            PrimeWear is a multi-vendor marketplace. Each product on our platform is sold and shipped
            directly by independent vendors. Shipping timelines, costs, and carriers are set by
            individual vendors. This policy explains how shipping works across all orders placed
            on PrimeWear.

            We currently deliver within Sri Lanka only. Vendors may restrict delivery to specific
            provinces or districts. You will see the available shipping options at checkout based
            on your delivery address.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">3. Shipping Costs</h2>
          <p>
            Shipping fees are determined by each vendor and will be clearly displayed during
            checkout before you confirm your order. Costs may vary based on:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-muted-foreground pl-2">
            <li>Product weight and dimensions</li>
            <li>Delivery location (city vs. outstation)</li>
            <li>Chosen shipping carrier</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Some vendors may offer free shipping on orders above a minimum amount.

        <section className="space-y-3">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">4. Delivery Timelines</h2>
          <p>
            Estimated delivery times vary by vendor and delivery location:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-muted-foreground pl-2">
            <li><strong>Colombo &amp; suburbs:</strong> 1–3 business days</li>
            <li><strong>Other major cities:</strong> 2–5 business days</li>
            <li><strong>Outstation / rural areas:</strong> 3–7 business days</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These are estimates only. Actual delivery times depend on vendor dispatch speed,
            carrier workload, and external factors such as public holidays or adverse weather.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">5. Multi-Vendor Orders</h2>
          <p>
            If your cart contains items from multiple vendors, your order will be split into
            separate shipments — one per vendor. Each shipment is processed and dispatched
            independently. You may receive items at different times.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shipping costs for each vendor's portion of your order are calculated and charged
            separately at checkout.
          </p>

        <section className="space-y-3">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">6. Order Processing</h2>
          <p>
            Orders are processed after successful payment confirmation. You can track your
            order status through your account under <strong>My Orders</strong>. The order
            lifecycle is as follows:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-muted-foreground pl-2">
            <li><strong>Payment Confirmed</strong> – Your payment has been received</li>
            <li><strong>Processing</strong> – Vendor is preparing your order</li>
            <li><strong>Shipped</strong> – Your order has been dispatched; tracking info (if any) will be provided</li>
            <li><strong>Delivered</strong> – You confirm receipt of your order</li>

          <p>
            Please ensure your delivery address is accurate before placing an order. PrimeWear
            and our vendors are not responsible for failed deliveries due to an incorrect or
