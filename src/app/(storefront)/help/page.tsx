      {
        q: "How do I place an order?",
        a: "Browse products, add items to your cart, then proceed to checkout. You will need to be logged in with your email OTP to complete a purchase. At checkout you can select a delivery address, apply a coupon, and review your order before paying.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I cancel my order?",
        a: 'Yes. You can cancel an order within 24 hours of placing it, provided it has not yet been shipped. Go to My Orders, open the order, and click "Cancel Order". A full refund will be credited to your PrimeWear wallet.',
      },
      {
        q: "How do I track my order?",
        a: "Go to My Orders in your account. Each order shows its current status: Payment Confirmed → Processing → Shipped → Delivered. If the vendor has provided a tracking number it will appear on the order details page.",
      },
      {
        q: "My order contains items from multiple vendors — will they arrive together?",
        a: "No. Each vendor ships independently, so you may receive separate packages at different times. Shipping costs for each vendor are shown separately at checkout.",

    category: "Payments",
    items: [
      {
        q: "What payment methods are accepted?",
        a: "We accept Visa and Mastercard via PayHere, Sri Lanka's secure payment gateway. Your card details are entered directly on PayHere's encrypted page — PrimeWear never sees or stores your card number.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is my payment secure?",
        a: "Yes. All payments are processed through PayHere with SSL encryption. PrimeWear uses an escrow model — your money is held safely until you confirm delivery of your order.",
      },
      {
        q: "When does the vendor receive my payment?",
        a: "Vendor funds are only released after you confirm delivery. This protects you as a buyer. If you never confirm delivery, funds remain held and you can raise a dispute.",
      },
      {
        q: "I was charged but my order shows Payment Failed. What should I do?",
        a: "This can happen if the payment gateway timed out. Please wait a few minutes and check your order status again. If your bank was charged but the order remains in a failed state, contact us at support@primewear.lk with your order number.",

  {
    category: "Shipping & Delivery",
    items: [
      {
        q: "How long does delivery take?",
        a: "Estimated delivery times: Colombo & suburbs 1–3 business days, other major cities 2–5 business days, outstation/rural areas 3–7 business days. These are estimates and may vary by vendor and carrier.",
      },
      {
        q: "How much does shipping cost?",
        a: "Shipping costs are set by each vendor and shown clearly at checkout before you confirm your order. Some vendors offer free shipping above a minimum order amount.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I change my delivery address after ordering?",
        a: "Address changes after order placement cannot be guaranteed. Contact the vendor via the order chat as soon as possible. For future orders, ensure your address is correct before confirming.",

  {
    category: "Returns & Refunds",
    items: [
      {
        q: "Can I return an item?",
        a: 'Yes, within 24 hours of confirming delivery. Go to My Orders, open the order, and click "Request Return". See our Returns & Exchanges Policy for eligible reasons and non-returnable items.',
      },
      {
        q: "How are refunds processed?",
        a: "Approved refunds are credited to your PrimeWear wallet. Wallet funds can be used for future purchases on the platform. Refunds back to your original card are not currently supported.",
      },
      {
        q: "Who pays for return shipping?",
        a: "Return shipping is paid by the customer unless the return is due to a vendor error (wrong item, damaged on arrival). In that case the vendor is responsible for return shipping costs.",
      },

  {
    category: "Account",

      },
      {
        q: "How do I manage my delivery addresses?",
        a: "Go to your account and open the Address section. You can add, edit, or remove addresses. You can also set a default address that will be pre-selected at checkout.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I view my wallet balance?",
        a: "After logging in, go to your account to see your wallet balance. Your wallet shows your available balance (ready to use at checkout) and any pending refunds.",

  {
    category: "Disputes",
    items: [
      {
        q: "What if I have a problem with my order?",
        a: "First, try contacting the vendor using the chat on your order details page. If the issue is not resolved, you can open a formal dispute within 7 days of confirming delivery. Go to My Orders → Order Details → Open Dispute.",
      },
      {
        q: "How long does a dispute take to resolve?",
        a: "Our admin team aims to review and resolve disputes as quickly as possible. You will receive a notification when a decision is made. You can add comments and evidence to your dispute at any time while it is open.",
