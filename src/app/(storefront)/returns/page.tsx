          <p>
            Return shipping costs are the responsibility of the customer, unless the return is
            due to a vendor error (e.g. wrong item sent, damaged on arrival). In cases of vendor
            error, the vendor is responsible for arranging or reimbursing return shipping.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please do not send items back before your return request is approved. Unapproved
            returns may not be accepted.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">7. Refund Process</h2>

            be processed. Approved refunds are credited to your <strong>PrimeWear wallet</strong>.
            Wallet funds can be used for future purchases on the platform.
